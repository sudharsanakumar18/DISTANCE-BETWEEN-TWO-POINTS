# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Input the coordinates of the point(x1, y1) and the second point(x2, y2).
### Step 2: 
Calculate the difference between the x-coordinates.
### Step 3:
Calculate the difference between the y-coordinates.
### Step 4: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 5: 
Run the program
### PROGRAM:
```
  import math
l2=[10,6]
l1=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```

### OUTPUT:
